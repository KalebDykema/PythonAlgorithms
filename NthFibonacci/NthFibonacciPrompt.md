# Nth Fibonacci Prompt
To test your code, run `python3 ./NthFibonacci/nth_fibonacci_test.py`.

## What is the fibonacci seuqence?
The fibonaci sequence is a continuing sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1. This would continue as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

## What do you need to solve?
Create a function that takes in a given index and returns that index in the fibonacci sequence. For example:
```
Input
n = 3
Output
1 // 0, 1, 1

Input
n = 8
Ouput
13 // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
```

## Assumptions
- The input will always be an integer.
- Don't worry about input less than 1.
